# VKI LS89
LS89 is a high-pressure turbine guide vane designed by the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics (VKI) in Belgium, 
renowned for its high loading characteristics. The flow around LS89 is typically high-speed and high-Reynolds-number, 
accompanied by significant secondary flow losses, making it a classic case for studying secondary flows 
(such as horseshoe vortices and passage vortices) and the mechanisms of total pressure loss generation. 
These complex three-dimensional flow structures impose stringent requirements on mesh topology and local refinement strategies, 
especially in the endwall regions. Under certain operating conditions, LS89 may also exhibit local shock waves, 
further increasing the complexity of the flow field and mesh. VKI has conducted comprehensive experimental investigations on LS89, 
providing high-quality performance and flow field measurement data, making it an important resource for CFD validation.

## Simulation tips
Although 2D or 2.5D meshes can capture some key phenomena, as mentioned in the introduction, it is difficult to accurately predict the transition location matching the experiment without considering endwall effects.

In the tests, the mesh used by the author has a $y_{wall}$ of about 5e-5. Since the outlet Mach number in the MUR47 experiment exceeds 1, numerical dissipation in the wake region has a significant impact on back pressure propagation, so the outlet mesh needs to be refined.

For spatial discretization, using JST can lead to noticeable total pressure overshoot in the wake. Using ROE+MUSCL while keeping the limiter as VAN\_ALBADA\_EDGE (ENTROPY\_FIX\_COEFF=0.001) yields simulation results close to the experimental data.

It should also be noted that the outlet measurement position in this experiment is relatively upstream. If the outlet mesh in the simulation is longer, consider slightly adjusting the outlet static pressure.
