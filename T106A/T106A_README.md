# T106A

The T106 profile is a representative mid-span section design of the rotor blade in the Pratt & Whitney PW2037 engine, which was once an optional powerplant for the Boeing 757 aircraft. Modern aeroengine design trends aim to reduce the number of low-pressure turbine blades to lower weight and manufacturing costs. This requires each blade to withstand higher aerodynamic loads, leading to the development of “ultra-high-lift” profiles like T106. These profiles are characterized by higher velocity peaks on the suction side, followed by significant diffusion, which makes boundary layer separation and transition phenomena more pronounced.

T106A and T106C are both classic low-pressure turbine cascades, representing light and heavy loading conditions, respectively (with the T106A experiments also considering the effects of upstream and downstream wakes). Flow in low-pressure turbines is typically characterized by low Reynolds numbers and high incidence angles, and is often accompanied by laminar separation and transition. Both cascades feature a suction side prone to flow separation and laminar-to-turbulent transition. Accurate capture of these phenomena requires high-resolution meshes to resolve the boundary layer, especially in the separation and reattachment regions.

## Simulation tips

Extensive experimental tests have been conducted by numerous laboratories on the T106 series cascade under various operating conditions.
The most frequently cited experimental data for the T106A primarily originate from the work of Peter Stadtmüller et al. in 2000–2001 
and the work of Rory Douglas Stieger in 2002–2003, with differences in dimensional scaling and installation setups. 
In this work, the author adopts the experimental results from Peter Stadtmüller.
Since the T106A-EIZ mainly investigates the influence of wakes on the main flow, although the literature states that the cylinders 
of the wake generator were not installed during steady-state experiments, the presence of the upstream moving belts still exerts 
a minor influence on the inlet airflow. Consequently, based on extensive simulation tests, some researchers have corrected 
the inlet flow angle (modifying it from $37.7^{\circ}$ to $45.5^{\circ}$ or $46.1^{\circ}$).

In this study, the mesh used by the author features a $y_{wall}$ of $1.0 \times 10^{-5}$ and a $z_{wall}$ of $1.0 \times 10^{-4}$. 
The SU2 calculation can be directly initiated using the 2nd-order spatial Roe scheme combined with the MUSCL limiter
