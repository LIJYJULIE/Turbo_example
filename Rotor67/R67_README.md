# Rotor67

Rotor 67 is the first-stage rotor of a two-stage fan designed by the NASA Lewis Research Center, 
with the core design objective of significantly enhancing overall fan performance and efficiency. 
Its most distinctive feature is the adoption of a low aspect ratio, intended to eliminate the mid-span dampers typically 
required in traditional turbomachinery fans for vibration suppression and aerodynamic stability. 
This design simplifies the structure and reduces aerodynamic losses. Experimental results indicate that it achieved efficiency 
exceeding expectations at the design pressure ratio, with the first-stage rotor attaining an adiabatic efficiency of 0.906, 
which is 2 percentage points higher than the design target. Furthermore, the optimized radial load distribution enables 
the fan to better handle boundary layer defects in the tip region, further improving overall performance. 
Rotor 67 consists of 22 multiple-circular-arc (MCA) blades and is designed for axial inlet flow, requiring no inlet guide vanes. 
M.J.Pierzga et al. acquired laser anemometry and aerodynamic performance data for this design under operating conditions 
near peak efficiency and near stall, which can be utilized for comparative simulation analysis.

## Simulation tips

In the provided test case, the convergence of Rotor 67 is notably slower than that of Rotor 37, 
despite the wall spacing ($y_{wall}$ and $z_{wall}$) being refined to $1.0 \times 10^{-6}$. 
To ensure numerical stability, the simulation employed an initial CFL number of 1.0 with adaptive stepping enabled. 
The solution was advanced using the SST turbulence model with the V1994m formulation for the first 20,000 iterations,
followed by a restart using V2003m for an additional 20,000 iterations to obtain the presented results. 
The JST scheme was utilized for spatial discretization; 
maintaining stability with the Roe scheme proved more challenging, 
as it imposes stricter requirements on leading-edge grid resolution and the trade-off between numerical dissipation
and solution accuracy.
