# Rotor67

Rotor 67 is the first-stage rotor of a two-stage fan designed by the NASA Lewis Research Center, 
with the core design objective of significantly enhancing overall fan performance and efficiency. 
Its most distinctive feature is the adoption of a low aspect ratio, intended to eliminate the mid-span dampers typically 
required in traditional turbomachinery fans for vibration suppression and aerodynamic stability. 
This design simplifies the structure and reduces aerodynamic losses. Experimental results indicate that it achieved efficiency 
exceeding expectations at the design pressure ratio, with the first-stage rotor attaining an adiabatic efficiency of 0.906, 
which is 2 percentage points higher than the design target. Furthermore, the optimized radial load distribution enables 
the fan to better handle boundary layer defects in the tip region, further improving overall performance. 
Rotor 67 consists of 22 multiple-circular-arc (MCA) blades and is designed for axial inlet flow, requiring no inlet guide vanes. 
M.J.Pierzga et al. acquired laser anemometry and aerodynamic performance data for this design under operating conditions 
near peak efficiency and near stall, which can be utilized for comparative simulation analysis.
