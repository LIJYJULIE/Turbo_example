# T106C

The T106 profile is a representative mid-span section design of the rotor blade in the Pratt & Whitney PW2037 engine, 
which was once an optional powerplant for the Boeing 757 aircraft. Modern aeroengine design trends aim to reduce the number of 
low-pressure turbine blades to lower weight and manufacturing costs. This requires each blade to withstand higher aerodynamic loads, 
leading to the development of “ultra-high-lift” profiles like T106. These profiles are characterized by higher velocity peaks 
on the suction side, followed by significant diffusion, which makes boundary layer separation and transition phenomena more pronounced.

T106A and T106C are both classic low-pressure turbine cascades, representing light and heavy loading conditions, 
respectively (with the T106A experiments also considering the effects of upstream and downstream wakes). 
Flow in low-pressure turbines is typically characterized by low Reynolds numbers and high incidence angles, 
and is often accompanied by laminar separation and transition. Both cascades feature a suction side prone to flow separation 
and laminar-to-turbulent transition. Accurate capture of these phenomena requires high-resolution meshes to resolve the boundary layer,
especially in the separation and reattachment regions.

## Simulation tips

The most widely cited experimental data for the T106C primarily originates from the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics (VKI), 
such as the work by Hoheisel et al. in 1990. However, due to the difficulty in publicly accessing these early resources, 
a literature report from 2010, also originating from VKI, is provided here. 

Unlike the T106A, the T106C is free from upstream and downstream experimental interference; consequently, 
numerous studies have utilized it as a benchmark case for validating solvers, turbulence models, and transition models.

In this study, the mesh used by the author features a $y_{wall}$ of $1.0 \times 10^{-5}$ and a $z_{wall}$ of $1.0 \times 10^{-4}$. 
The SU2 calculation can be directly initiated using the 2nd-order spatial Roe scheme combined with the MUSCL limiter
